        Investment products designed by Terminus Ventures (Terminus GP S.à r.l.
        and any of its associates incl. Terminus Seed Fund SCSp) are tailored
        exclusively for "Professional Investors", as defined under the Markets
        in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), who are capable of making
        their own investment decisions, properly assessing associated risks, and
        affirming they meet the minimum investment threshold of EUR 125,000.
        Terminus GP S.à r.l. acts as an AIFM of Terminus Seed Fund SCSp and is
        subject to Luxembourg law. This website serves purely for informational
        and marketing purposes in jurisdictions where distribution or use of
        such information is lawful. It is designed to inform about Terminus
        Ventures investment approach, without constituting an offer,
        solicitation, recommendation, or advice to buy or sell securities or to
        engage in any investment strategy.<br />
        In accordance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR),
        Terminus Ventures hereby discloses that it does not consider the adverse
        impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors within the
        investment decision-making process. Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation
        (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial
        services sector (SFDR), the Fund classifies itself as a financial
        product that does not promote environmental or social characteristics
        nor has sustainable investment as its objective. This position reflects
        our focused investment strategy (Seed and Series A investments) where
        ESG risks are considered immaterial. Our approach to sustainability
        factors and risk assessment is to prioritize financial performance while
        acknowledging that the fund does not actively engage in evaluating
        environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria as part of its
        investment analysis. This is because, in the context of the fund's
        investment strategy, it is not possible to conduct detailed diligence on
        the principal adverse impacts of the investments on sustainability
        factors, as the availability of datapoints limits the ability to
        systematically assess the potential adverse impact of investment
        decisions on all sustainability factors. Investors should note that this
        approach may evolve as market practices and regulatory frameworks
        develop.<br />
