      Investment products designed by Terminus Ventures (Terminus GP S.à r.l.
      and any of its associates incl. Terminus Seed Fund SCSp) are tailored
      exclusively for "Professional Investors", as defined under the Markets
      in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), who are capable of making
      their own investment decisions, properly assessing associated risks, and
      affirming they meet the minimum investment threshold of EUR 125,000.
      Terminus GP S.à r.l. acts as an AIFM of Terminus Seed Fund SCSp and is
      subject to Luxembourg law. This website serves purely for informational
      and marketing purposes in jurisdictions where distribution or use of
      such information is lawful. It is designed to inform about Terminus
      Ventures investment approach, without constituting an offer,
      solicitation, recommendation, or advice to buy or sell securities or to
      engage in any investment strategy.<br />
      In accordance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR),
      Terminus Ventures hereby discloses that it does not consider the adverse
      impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors within the
      investment decision-making process. Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation
      (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial
      services sector (SFDR), the Fund classifies itself as a financial
      product that does not promote environmental or social characteristics
      nor has sustainable investment as its objective. This position reflects
      our focused investment strategy (Seed and Series A investments) where
      ESG risks are considered immaterial. Our approach to sustainability
      factors and risk assessment is to prioritize financial performance while
      acknowledging that the fund does not actively engage in evaluating
      environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria as part of its
      investment analysis. This is because, in the context of the fund's
      investment strategy, it is not possible to conduct detailed diligence on
      the principal adverse impacts of the investments on sustainability
      factors, as the availability of datapoints limits the ability to
      systematically assess the potential adverse impact of investment
      decisions on all sustainability factors. Investors should note that this
      approach may evolve as market practices and regulatory frameworks
      develop.<br />
