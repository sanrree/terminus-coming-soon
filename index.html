      Important notice Investment products designed by Terminus Ventures
      (Terminus GP S.à r.l. and any of its associates incl. Terminus Seed Fund
      SCSp) are tailored exclusively for "Professional Investors", as defined
      under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), who are
      capable of making their own investment decisions, properly assessing
      associated risks, and affirming they meet the minimum investment threshold
      of EUR 125,000. This website serves purely for informational and marketing
      purposes in jurisdictions where distribution or use of such information is
      lawful. It is designed to inform about Terminus Ventures investment
      approach, without constituting an offer, solicitation, recommendation, or
      advice to buy or sell securities or to engage in any investment strategy.
      In accordance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR),
      Terminus Ventures hereby discloses that it does not consider the adverse
      impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors within the
      investment decision-making process. This position reflects our focused
      investment strategy (Seed and Series A investments) where ESG risks are
      considered immaterial. Our approach to sustainability factors and risk
      assessment is to prioritize financial performance while acknowledging that
      the fund does not actively engage in evaluating environmental, social, and
      governance (ESG) criteria as part of its investment analysis. This is
      because, in the context of the fund’s investment strategy, it is not
      possible to conduct detailed diligence on the principal adverse impacts of
      the investments on sustainability factors, as the availability of
      datapoints limits the ability to systematically assess the potential
      adverse impact of investment decisions on all sustainability factors.
      Investors should note that this approach may evolve as market practices
      and regulatory frameworks develop. All information provided on this
      website is without representations or warranties of any kind, and Terminus
      Ventures expressly disclaims any liability for errors, omissions, or
      inaccuracies contained herein. The content is not to be reproduced,

      Professional Investors, agree to the terms herein, and acknowledge that
      the site's content does not constitute an investment offer. For more
      information about our fund, investment strategy, or inquiries about
